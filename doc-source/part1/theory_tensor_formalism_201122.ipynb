However, since these terms are fairly simply followed algebraically in this case, via the rules inherent in the $3j$ product (Eq. {eq}`eq:basis-BLM-defn`), this is not particularly insightful (although useful pedagogically).

    "{numref}`fig-deltaTerm000` illustrates the alignment tensor $\\Delta_{L,M}(K,Q,S)$ for some basic cases, and values are also tabulated in {numref}`tab-deltaTerm000`. Note that for illustration purposes the term is subselected with $K=0$, $Q=0$, $S=0$ and $R'=0$; $R\\neq0$ terms are included to illustrate the elliptically-polarized case, which can give rise to non-zero $M$ terms.\n",

    "For the simplest case of an unaligned ensemble, this term is restricted to $K=Q=S=0$, i.e. $\\Delta_{L,M}(0,0,0)$; for single-photon ionization with linearly-polarized light ($p=0$, hence $P=0,2$ and $R=R'=0$), this has non-zero values for $L=0,2$ and $M=0$ only. Typically, this simplest case is synonymous with standard {{ LF }} results, and maintains cylindrical and up-down symmetry in the observable.\n",

For elliptically polarized light, mixing of terms with different $p$ allows for non-zero $R$ terms, hence non-zero $M$ is allowed, signifying breaking of cylindrical symmetry in the observable."

    "Here the density matrix can be interpreted as the final, LF/AF or MF density matrix (depending on the channel functions used), incorporating both the intrinsic and extrinsic effects (i.e. all channel couplings and radial matrix elements for the given measurement), with dimensions dependent on the unique sets of quantum numbers required - in the simplest case, this will just be a set of partial waves $\\zeta = (l,m)$. \n",

For reconstruction problems, it is usually the reduced form of Eq. {eq}`eqn:radial-density-mat` that is of interest, since the remainder of the problem is already described analytically by the channel functions $\\varUpsilon_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}$. In other words, the retrieval of the radial matrix elements $\\mathbb{I}^{\\zeta,\\zeta'}$ and the radial density matrix $\\rho^{\\zeta\\zeta'}$ are equivalent, and both can be viewed as completely describing the photoionization dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $L,M$ notation for the full density matrix ${\\rho}_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}$ (Eq. {eq}`eqn:full-density-mat`) indicates here that these dimensions should not be summed over, hence the tensor coupling into the $\\beta_{L,M}^{u}$ parameters can also be written directly in terms of the density matrix:\n",

    "In fact, this form arises naturally since the $\\beta_{L,M}^{u}$ terms are the state multipoles (geometric tensors) defining the system, which can be thought of as a coupled basis equivalent of the density matrix representations (see, e.g., Ref. {cite}`BlumDensityMat`, Chpt. 4.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more traditional notation (following Eq. {eq}`eq:continuum-state-vec`, see also Ref. {cite}`gregory2022LaboratoryFrameDensitya`), the density operator can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The main benefit of a density matrix representation in the current work is as a rapid way to visualize the phase relations between the photoionization matrix elements (the off-diagonal density matrix elements), and the ability to quickly check the overall pattern of the elements, hence confirm that no phase-relations are missing and orthogonality relations are fulfilled - some examples are given below. Since the method for computing the density matrices is also numerically equivalent to a tensor outer-product, density matrices and visualizations can also be rapidly composed for other properties of interest, e.g. the various channel functions defined herein, providing another complementary methodology and tool for investigation. (Further examples can be found in the {{ ePSproc_docs }}, as well as in the literature, see, e.g., Ref. {cite}`BlumDensityMat` for general discussion, Ref. {cite}`Reid1991` for application in pump-probe schemes.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as noted above, the density matrix elements provide a complete description of the photoionization event, and hence make clear the equivalence of the ``complete\" photoionization experiments (and associated continuum reconstruction methods) discussed herein, with general quantum tomography schemes {cite}`MauroDAriano2003`. The density matrix can also be used as the starting point for further analysis based on standard density matrix techniques - this is discussed, for instance, in Ref. {cite}`BlumDensityMat`, and can also be viewed as a bridge between traditional methods in spectroscopy and AMO physics, and more recent concepts in the quantum information sciences (see, e.g., Refs. {cite}`Tichy2011a,Yuen-Zhou2014` for recent discussions in this context)."
