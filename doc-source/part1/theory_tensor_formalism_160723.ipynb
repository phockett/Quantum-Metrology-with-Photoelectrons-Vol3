    "\n",
    "A number of authors have treated {{ PADs }} and related problems in the context of photoionization theory and matrix element reconstruction (see {{ QM2 }} Chpt. 8 for examples and discussion, a range of review articles can also be found in the literature, e.g. Refs. {cite}`Becker1998, Reid2003, Kleinpoppen2005, kleinpoppen2013perfect`); herein, a geometric tensor based formalism is developed, which is close in spirit to the treatments given by Underwood and co-workers {cite}`Reid2000,Stolow2008,Underwood2000`, but further separates various sets of physical parameters into dedicated tensors; this allows for a unified theoretical and numerical treatment, where the latter computes properties as tensor variables which can be further manipulated and investigated to give detailed insights into various aspects of photoionization for the system at hand, and implications/effects for matrix element retrieval in a given case. Furthermore, the tensors can readily be converted to a density matrix representation {cite}`BlumDensityMat,zareAngMom`, which is more natural for some quantities, and also emphasizes the link to quantum state tomography and other quantum information techniques. Much of the theoretical background, as well as application to aspects of the current problem, can be found in the textbooks of Blum {cite}`BlumDensityMat` and Zare {cite}`zareAngMom`. \n",

The {{ PEMtk_repo }} codebase implements {{ RADMATE }} retrieval based on the tensor formalism, with pre-computation of all the geometric tensor components ({{ GAMMACHANNEL }}) prior to a fitting protocol for matrix element analysis, essentially a fit to Eqn. {eq}`eqn:channel-fns`, with terms $I^{\\zeta}(\\epsilon)$ as the unknowns (in magnitude, phase form per {eq}`eqn:I-zeta-mag-phase`). The main computational cost of a tensor-based approach is that more RAM is required to store the full set of tensor variables; however, the method is computationally efficient since it is inherently parallel (as compared to a traditional, serial loop-based solution), hence may lead to significantly faster evaluation of observables. Furthermore, the method allows for the computational routines to match the formalism quite closely, and for the investigation of the properties of the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }} for a given problem in general terms, as well as for specific experimental cases including examination of specific couplings/effects. (Again, this is in contrast to standard nested-loop routines, which can be somewhat opaque to detailed interpretation, and typically implement the full computation of the observables in one monolithic computational routine; they do, however, have significantly lower RAM requirements since the full multi-dimensional basis tensors are not required to be stored.) {numref}`Sect. %s <sec:full-tensor-expansion>` provides details of the tensor components of the {{ GAMMACHANNEL }}, and the remainder of this section breaks these down further, including numerical examples, and discussion of their significance for fitting problems in specific cases.\n",

However, since these terms are fairly simply followed algebraically in this case, via the rules inherent in the $3j$ product (Eq. {eq}`eq:basis-BLM-defn`), this is not particularly insightful (although useful pedagogically). These visualizations will become more useful when dealing with real sets of matrix elements, and specific polarization geometries, which will further modulate or restrict the $B_{L,M}$ terms. \n",

For reconstruction problems, it is usually the reduced form of Eq. {eq}`eqn:radial-density-mat` that is of interest, since the remainder of the problem is already described analytically by the channel functions $\\varUpsilon_{L,M}^{u,\\zeta\\zeta'}$.

Since the method for computing the density matrices is also numerically equivalent to a tensor outer-product, density matrices and visualizations can also be rapidly composed for other properties of interest, e.g. the various channel functions defined herein, providing another complementary methodology and tool for investigation. (Further examples can be found in the {{ ePSproc_docs }}, as well as in the literature, see, e.g., Ref. {cite}`BlumDensityMat` for general discussion, Ref. {cite}`Reid1991` for application in pump-probe schemes.) \n",

The density matrix can also be used as the starting point for further analysis based on standard density matrix techniques - this is discussed, for instance, in Ref. {cite}`BlumDensityMat`, and can also be viewed as a bridge between traditional methods in spectroscopy and AMO physics, and more recent concepts in the quantum information sciences (see, e.g., Refs. {cite}`Tichy2011a,Yuen-Zhou2014` for recent discussions in this context)."
