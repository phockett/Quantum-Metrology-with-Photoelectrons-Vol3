  abstract = {A quantum theory of intense-field pump-probe experiments proposed by us recently [ F. H. M. Faisal et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 143001 (2007) and F. H. M. Faisal and A. Abdurrouf Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 123005 (2008)] is derived here fully and applied to investigate the phenomena of dynamic alignment and high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from coherently rotating linear molecules. The theory is developed from the basic quantum transition amplitude for the HHG and used to relate the Fourier transform (FT) of the expectation value of the dipole operator to the rate of emission of the HHG photons. It permits us to give analytical expressions for the HHG signals and their simultaneous dependence on the two externally available control parameters\textemdash the delay-time, td, between the pump and the probe pulse, and the relative angle, {$\alpha$}, between their polarizations. A relation between the basic ``one-molecule'' and the macroscopic ``many-molecule'' HHG signals is obtained from the phase-matching condition for HHG in an ideal medium. The requirement for the coherent HHG signal and the ``elastic'' molecular transition, in contrast to the ``inelastic'' transitions and the ``hyper-Raman'' emission, is discussed. The effect of the ``delayed'' probe pulse on the dynamic alignment induced by the pump-pulse, the mean rotational energy of the molecule during the period between the pump and the probe pulse, as well as a method of estimating the effective temperature of the molecules are analyzed. A ``revival theorem'' on the number of fractional ``revivals,'' equal to the lowest power of the ``cosine operator'' in the Hamiltonian of the system, times the maximum powers of the ``cosine-moments'' present in the signal, is derived and used to interpret the observed fractional revivals and their relative phases. A ``magic'' polarization angle {$\alpha$}c=arctan {$\surd$}2{$\approx$}55\textdegree, at which the signals for all td approach each other closely, is identified as a generic signature of a {$\sigma$}g symmetry of the active orbital. Similarly, the presence of a ``crossing neighborhood'' near {$\alpha$}c is shown to be a generic signature of an active {$\pi$}g orbital. At an operational angle {$\alpha$}c{$\approx$}55\textdegree{} in the laboratory, a steady emission of high-order harmonic radiation from coherently rotating molecules with {$\sigma$}g orbital symmetry (e.g., N2) can be obtained. Finally, explicit numerical calculations are performed at specific experimental parameter values in the time domain as well as in the frequency domain. The results well reproduce all the salient features of the experimental observations for N2 and O2, and provide a unified theoretical interpretation of the same.},

  abstract = {The wave nature of particles is rarely observed, in part because of their very short de Broglie wavelengths in most situations. However, even with wavelengths close to the size of their surroundings, the particles couple to their environment (for example, by gravity, Coulomb interaction, or thermal radiation). These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference.},

Several features of formal interest are noted and clarified. Our approach is nonperturbative, treating the laser field within classical and the material system within quantum mechanics. The theory is implemented numerically using a basis set of rotational eigenstates, transforming the time-dependent Schrodinger equation to a set of coupled differential equations where all matrix elements are analytically soluble. The approach was applied over the past few years to explore different adiabatic and nonadiabatic three-dimensional alignment approaches in conjunction with experiments, but its formal details and numerical implementation were not reported in previous studies. Although we provide simple numerical examples to illustrate the content of the equations, our main goal is to complement previous reports through an introductory discussion of the underlying theory.},

The technique is based on mixing the unknown object state with a known reference state generated in the same system by two delayed laser pulses, and detecting the total time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence as a function of the delay. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by reconstructing various vibrational wave packets in sodium dimers. Both the cases of completely controlled and noisy relative phase between the laser pulses are considered. In the latter case, we use the technique of coherence observation by interference noise to recover the interference component of the fluorescence signal. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness of quantum-state holog- raphy and the high quality of reconstruction even in the presence of the external noise. ?S1050-2947?99?06403-3?},

  abstract = {We employ the recently developed multiphoton R-matrix method for molecular above-threshold photoionization to obtain second-order ionization amplitudes that govern the interference in RABITT experiments. This allows us to extract RABITT time delays that are in better agreement with nonperturbative time-dependent simulations of this process than the typically used combination of first-order (Wigner) delays and asymptotic corrections. We calculate molecular-frame as well as orientation-averaged RABITT delays for H2, N2, CO2, H2O, and N2O and analyze the origin of various structures in the time delays including the effects of partial-wave interference, shape resonances, and orientation averaging. Time delays for B and C states of CO2+ are strongly affected by absorption of the second (IR) photon in the ion. This effect corresponds to an additional contribution {$\tau$}coupl to the asymptotic approximation for the RABITT delays {$\tau\approx\tau$}mol+{$\tau$}cc+{$\tau$}coupl. Applicability of the asymptotic theory depends on the target and IR photon energy but typically starts at approximately 30\textendash 35 eV of XUV photon energy.},

By deconvolving the laboratory frame alignment distribution, what was previously thought to be a maximum of emission along the molecular axis is found to be maxima at 35 degrees off axis, with a spectral minimum on axis. Both of these features are supported by photoionization calculations that underline the relationship between high-harmonic spectroscopy and photoionization measurements. The calculations reveal that the on axis spectral minimum is a Cooper-like minimum that arises from the destructive interference of the p and f partial wave contributions to high-harmonic photorecombination. Features such as Cooper minima and shape resonances are ubiquitous in molecular photoionization or recombination.},

  abstract = {Following structural dynamics in real time is a fundamental goal towards a better understanding of chemical reactions. Recording snapshots of individual molecules with ultrashort exposure times is a key ingredient towards this goal, as atoms move on femtosecond (10-15\,s) timescales. For condensed-phase samples, ultrafast, atomically resolved structure determination has been demonstrated using X-ray and electron diffraction. Pioneering experiments have also started addressing gaseous samples. However, they face the problem of low target densities, low scattering cross sections and random spatial orientation of the molecules. Therefore, obtaining images of entire, isolated molecules capturing all constituents, including hydrogen atoms, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that intense femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser trigger rapid and complete Coulomb explosions of 2-iodopyridine and 2-iodopyrazine molecules. We obtain intriguingly clear momentum images depicting ten or eleven atoms, including all the hydrogens, and thus overcome a so-far impregnable barrier for complete Coulomb explosion imaging\textemdash its limitation on molecules consisting of three to five atoms. In combination with state-of-the-art multi-coincidence techniques and elaborate theoretical modelling, this allows tracing ultrafast hydrogen emission and obtaining information on the result of intramolecular electron rearrangement. Our work represents an important step towards imaging femtosecond chemistry via Coulomb explosion.},

Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn\textendash Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.},

  abstract = {RMT is a programme which solves the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for general, multielectron atoms, ions and molecules interacting with laser light. As such it can be used to model ionization (single-photon, multiphoton and strong-field), recollision (high-harmonic generation, strong-field rescattering) and, more generally, absorption or scattering processes with a full account of the multielectron correlation effects in a time-dependent manner. Calculations can be performed for targets interacting with ultrashort, intense laser pulses of long wavelength and arbitrary polarization. Calculations for atoms can optionally include the Breit\textendash Pauli correction terms for the description of relativistic (in particular, spin\textendash orbit) effects. Program summary Program Title: (RMT) R-matrix with time-dependence Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3ptyfg2bmx.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran Nature of problem: The interaction of laser light with matter can be modelled with the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE). The solution of the TDSE for general, multielectron atomic and molecular systems is computationally demanding, and has previously been limited either to particular laser wavelengths and intensities, or to simple, few-electron cases. RMT overcomes this limitation by using a general approach to modelling dynamics in atoms and molecules which is applicable to multielectron systems and a wide range of perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena. Solution method: We use the R-matrix paradigm, partitioning the interaction region into an `inner' and an `outer' region. In the inner region (within some small radius of the nucleus/nuclei), full account is taken of all multielectron interactions including electron exchange and correlation. In the outer region, far from the nucleus/nuclei, these are neglected and a single, ionized electron moves in the long-range potential of the residual ionic system and the laser field. The key computational aspect of the RMT approach is the use of a different numerical scheme in each region, facilitating efficient parallelization without sacrificing accuracy. Given an initial wavefunction and the electric field of the driving laser pulse, the wavefunction for all subsequent times and the associated observables are computed using an explicit, Arnoldi propagator method. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The description of the atomic/molecular structure is provided from other, time-independent R-matrix codes [1], [2], [3], and the capabilities (in terms of structure) are, in some sense, inherited therefrom. Thus, the atomic calculations can optionally include Breit\textendash Pauli relativistic corrections to the Hamiltonian, in order to account for the spin\textendash orbit effect. However, no such capability exists for the molecular case. Furthermore, the fixed-nuclei approximation is adopted in the molecular calculations (so nuclear motion is neglected). Similarly, all calculations are restricted to the description of a single electron in the outer region, and consequently the study of double-ionization phenomena is not yet within the capabilities of the method. Finally, the parallel strategy employed necessitates the use of at least two (and usually many more) computer cores. As a result, there is no option for serial calculations and, for most realistic cases, a massively parallel architecture (several hundred cores) will be required.

First a weak, impulsive pump pulse initializes the system via the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect. Then, having overcome the influence of the vacuum fluctuations, an amplification pulse selectively enhances the initial coherences by transient stimulated Raman scattering, generating alignment and angular momentum orientation of molecular hydrogen. The amplitude and phase of the resulting coherent dynamics are experimentally probed, indicating an amplification factor of 4.5. An analytic theory is developed to model the dynamics.},

This includes conceptual developments in ML motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross fertilization between the two fields. After giving a basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, examples are described of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. This review then describes applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many-body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. Research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML are also highlighted. Each of the sections describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.},

The polarisation for the (nl)N subshell, with l\${$>\$$}or=1 and 1\${$<\$$}or=N\${$<\$$}or=4l+2, arises from spin-orbit splitting at the initial and (or) final states. To observe this polarisation it is necessary to select the photoelectrons corresponding to the transition from a particular fine-structure level of the initial state to a particular fine-structure level of the final state. The effect exists at all photon energies. The degree of polarisation depends on the energy and polarisation of the photons, the angle of electron ejection and the atomic characteristics. After integration over the electron ejection angles the degree of polarisation becomes equal to zero when unpolarised or linearly polarised light is absorbed and remains non-zero for absorption of circularly polarised light. The degree of polarisation of the photoelectrons ejected from the 2p6 and 3p6 subshells of Ar and the 4d10 and 5p6 subshells of Xe, calculated in the random-phase approximation with exchange, is presented.},

In atoms the complete experiment must include measurements of the angular distribution and spin polarization of photoelectrons and the alignment or/and orientation of the residual ion. Two relations connecting the spin polarization parameters and the parameters characterizing the ion polarization state are presented. The complete experiments performed for Xe atom demonstrated a good agreement between theory and experiment. The complete experiments in photoionization of diatomic molecules can be performed by measuring photoelectron angular distributions for fixed-in-space molecules with circularly or elliptically polarized light. The use of additional experimental data like the angular asymmetry parameter ?? and the ratio of ?? to ?? symmetry resolved cross sections made it possible to extract as many as 16 dipole matrix elements and phase shift differences for the C K-shell of CO molecule. Comparison with the recent calculations in the relaxed core Hartree-Fock approximation revealed discrepancies between theory and experiment. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article summarizes theoretical studies of molecular state determination by wave-packet interferometry (WPI) and recounts some recent experimental applications of molecular WPI. Calculations predict that two-color nonlinear WPI data can be used to reconstruct a rovibronic target wave packet evolving under an incompletely characterized nuclear Hamiltonian. This can be accomplished by the isolation via phase cycling or wave-vector matching of an exhaustive collection of overlaps between the unknown target and the members of a family of reference wave packets whose form is known by construction. This review highlights recent experiments employing WPI to gain amplitude-level information about the photoexcited-state dynamics of small molecules in the gas phase and in rare-gas crystals. I briefly describe a new semiclassical theory for condensed-phase WPI and other coherence-spectroscopy measurements, such as time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and mention our initial studies of nonlinear WPI from electronic energy-transfer complexes.},

Coincidence spectroscopy is a powerful approach for carrying out a number of measurements. At its most basic level, coincidence techniques can identify the source of a specific signal, as in the well-known photoelectron-photoion coincidence approach used for several years. By carrying out coincidence experiments in an increasingly differential manner, correlated energy and angular distributions of reaction products may be recorded. Completely energy- and angle-resolved measurements of photoelectrons and ionic or neutral products can reveal molecular-frame photoelectron and photofragment angular distributions and aid in the characterization of dissociative states of molecules and ions. Recent work in this area is reviewed, including examples from studies of dissociative photodetachment, dissociative photoionization, time-resolved studies of dissociative photoionization, and three-body dissociation processes.},

In this letter we present a general method based on quantum tomography for measuring experimentally the matrix elements of an arbi-trary quantum operation. As input the method needs only a single entangled state. The feasibility of the technique for the electromagnetic field is shown, and the experimental setup is illustrated based on homodyne tomography of a twin-beam. The typical state change in quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution, where the final state is related to the initial one via the transformation {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) {$\equiv$} U {$\rho$}U , with U unitary operator on the Hilbert space H of the system. Unitary transformations describe only the evolu-tions of closed systems, and non-unitary transformations occur when the quantum system is coupled to an en-vironment or when a measurement is performed on the system. What is the most general possible state change in quantum mechanics? The answer is provided by the formalism of " quantum operations " by Kraus [1]. Here input and output states are connected via the map {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) Tr E({$\rho$}) . (1)},

  abstract = {Fascinating pictures that can be interpreted as showing molecular orbitals have been obtained with various imaging techniques. Among these, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has emerged as a particularly powerful method. Orbital images have been used to underline the physical credibility of the molecular orbital concept. However, from the theory of the photoemission process it is evident that imaging experiments do not show molecular orbitals, but Dyson orbitals. The latter are not eigenstates of a single-particle Hamiltonian and thus do not fit into the usual simple interpretation of electronic structure in terms of molecular orbitals. In a combined theoretical and experimental study we thus check whether a Dyson-orbital and a molecular-orbital based interpretation of ARPES lead to differences that are relevant on the experimentally observable scale. We discuss a scheme that allows for approximately calculating Dyson orbitals with moderate computational effort. Electronic relaxation is taken into account explicitly. The comparison reveals that while molecular orbitals are frequently good approximations to Dyson orbitals, a detailed understanding of photoemission intensities may require one to go beyond the molecular orbital picture. In particular we clearly observe signatures of the Dyson-orbital character for an adsorbed semiconductor molecule in ARPES spectra when these are recorded over a larger momentum range than in earlier experiments.},

Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning\textemdash demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.},

We consider whether ionization proceeds more favorably for the electric field co- or counter-rotating with the initial electronic current density. Strong asymmetries are found and quantitatively analyzed in terms of ``circular dichroism'' (CD). While the intensity dependence of the measured CD values is rather weak throughout the investigated regime, a very strong sensitivity on the center wavelength of the incoming radiation is observed. While the co-rotating situation overall prevails, the counter-rotating geometry is strongly favored around 800 nm due to the 2p-3s resonant transition, which can only be driven by counter-rotating fields. The observed features provide insights into the helicity dependence of light-atom interactions, and on the possible control of electron emission in atomic few-photon ionization by polarization-selective resonance enhancement.},

We find that scattering patterns, obtained by X-ray time-resolved imaging from an electronic wavepacket, encode spatial and temporal correlations that deviate substantially from the common notion of the instantaneous electronic density as the key quantity being probed. Surprisingly, the patterns provide an unusually visual manifestation of the quantum nature of light. This quantum nature becomes central only for non-stationary electronic states and has profound consequences for time-resolved imaging.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray scattering is an emerging approach to image the dynamical evolution of the electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering.},

  abstract = {A new step for complete experiments in photoionization (PI) of linear molecules is achieved when the electron-ion vector correlation method, based on imaging and time-of-flight resolved electron-ion coincidence techniques, is combined with the use of elliptically polarized light. The molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs), as well as the s1 and s2 Stokes parameters characterizing the polarization state of the light, can be derived from a single experiment performed with undefined elliptically polarized light. Using this method, we report and discuss MFPADs for site selective K-shell ionization of the NO and N2O linear molecules in the region of the N 1s and O 1s shape resonances. A large molecular frame circular dichroism is observed, well predicted by the multi-channel Schwinger configuration interaction calculations reported for PI of NO. We also present recent experimental results for PI of non-linear molecules like CH3Cl measured above the Cl 2p and C 1s ionization thresholds: the recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions (RFPADs) obtained by the vector correlation method may be influenced both by the molecular frame photoemission pattern and the fragmentation process.},

  abstract = {Current results and perspectives on the dynamics of photoionization of small molecules obtained from the analysis of Molecular Frame (MF) photoemission are reviewed. The MF observables intrinsically couple the ionized molecular orbital and the scattering wave function of the photoelectron in the ionization continuum. The field of molecular photoionization has benefited from the development of experimental methods based on the determination of electron-ion momentum vector correlations using position and time sensitive detectors, as well as from advanced ab initio calculations accounting for electronic correlations which influence the different steps of a photoionization reaction. Key features of valence shell and inner shell photoionization processes, involving resonant and non-resonant mechanisms, are illustrated for small molecules of increasing complexity: we emphasize the general formalism which describes molecular frame photoemission for single ionization of linear molecules induced by linearly and elliptically polarized light after one photon absorption, and its extensions to recoil frame photoemission when non-linear molecules or multiphoton processes are considered. The rich information contained in molecular frame photoemission is at the core of a number of recent experiments at the forefront of molecular physics.},

  abstract = {The field of angle-resolved molecular photoelectron spectroscopy is reviewed, with emphasis on foundations and most recent applications in different regimes of light\textendash matter interaction. The basic formalism underlying one-photon electron angular distributions is presented, from the primary molecular frame (MF) photoemission i.e. emission from fully oriented molecules to laboratory frame (LF) observables produced from randomly oriented targets, extensions to multiphoton and strong field processes being briefly described, followed by a survey of current quantum mechanical computational approaches. The description of experimental developments is focused on the advancements in two major instrumentation fields for angle-resolved PES of molecules in the last two decades, namely charged-particle imaging spectrometers and adiabatically or impulsively laser-induced molecular alignment, together with their interplay with the remarkable characteristics achieved nowadays by the ionizing light sources and the challenging control of complex molecules in the gas phase. Aspects and applications of LF angular observables from unoriented targets are presented, with contemporary applications, especially as probes of the target electronic structure, including higher angular observables, in particular photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) from chiral molecules, which is confirmed as a powerful chiral technique, and higher terms arising from multiphoton or non-dipole terms. Molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs), which stand out as the most complete observables of molecular photoionization stereodynamics in different excitation regimes, now broadly extended to characterize molecular structure and dynamics, are then discussed stemming from fully oriented molecules tackled by electron\textendash ion momentum coincidence techniques, or from laser aligned samples. Finally, novel developments and challenging perspectives, notably the implementation of PAD in time-resolved schemes at ultrashort time scales, high energy, and high intensity regimes are drawn.},

Identifying improvements for science software sustainability practices can contribute to the re-use of science software. A focus group study was conducted to identify ways to improve science software sustainability practices of the Earth science community. A facilitated, roundtable discussion activity at the 2014 Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Summer Meeting elicited recommendations on community activities to improve practices for the sustainability of scientific software. These suggestions fell into three broad themes \textendash{} (1) improving collaboration and community engagement through publications and presentations (2) developing workshops, training, and documenting best practices and (3) creating incentives and motivation with awards, citation and a reviewed software repository. In addition to the recommendations coming out of the roundtable activity, this paper highlights how community-led groups such as ESIP are key to move a sustainable software effort in its various forms from concept to reality.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Covariance mapping [L. J. Frasinski, K. Codling, and P. A. Hatherly, Science 246, 1029 (1989)] is a well-established technique used for the study of mechanisms of laser-induced molecular ionization and decomposition. It measures statistical correlations between fluctuating signals of pairs of detected species (ions, fragments, electrons). A positive correlation identifies pairs of products originating from the same dissociation or ionization event. A major challenge for covariance-mapping spectroscopy is accessing decompositions of large polyatomic molecules, where true physical correlations are overwhelmed by spurious signals of no physical significance induced by fluctuations in experimental parameters. As a result, successful applications of covariance mapping have so far been restricted to low-mass systems, e.g., organic molecules of around 50 daltons (Da). Partial-covariance mapping was suggested to tackle the problem of spurious correlations by taking into account the independently measured fluctuations in the experimental conditions. However, its potential has never been realized for the decomposition of large molecules, because in these complex situations, determining and continuously monitoring multiple experimental parameters affecting all the measured signals simultaneously becomes unfeasible. We introduce, through deriving theoretically and confirming experimentally, a conceptually new type of partial-covariance mapping\textemdash self-correcting partial-covariance spectroscopy\textemdash based on a parameter extracted from the measured spectrum itself. We use the readily available total ion count as the self-correcting partial-covariance parameter, thus eliminating the challenge of determining experimental parameter fluctuations in covariance measurements of large complex systems. The introduced self-correcting partial covariance enables us to successfully resolve correlations of molecules as large as 103\textendash 104 Da, 2 orders of magnitude above the state of the art. This opens new opportunities for mechanistic studies of large molecule decompositions through revealing their fragment-fragment correlations. Moreover, we demonstrate that self-correcting partial covariance is applicable to solving the inverse problem: reconstruction of a molecular structure from its fragment spectrum, within two-dimensional partial-covariance mass spectrometry.},

The technique combines bichromatic white light polarization pulse shaping with the tomographic reconstruction of photoelectron wave packets. The physical scheme is based on the interference of a probe wave packet from N + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization via the target states and a reference wave packet from M + 1 multiphoton ionization of the ground state. To create the wave packets, we employ carrier-envelope phase stable bichromatic (M{$\omega$}:N{$\omega$}) pump-probe pulse sequences. The scheme is demonstrated on femtosecond Rydberg wave-packet dynamics in potassium atoms using corotating circularly polarized (2{$\omega$}:3{$\omega$}) pulse sequences. The interference of continuum states with different angular momenta yields a crescent-shaped photoelectron wave packet rotating in the laser polarization plane due to the interplay of the optical phase and the accumulated quantum phase. Carrier-envelope phase control of the rotation provides access to the photoelectron asymmetry, enabling background-free detection of the crescent's angular motion which maps the bound-electron dynamics.},

The B-spline R-matrix method is employed to calculate accurate Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith time delays from multi- electron dipole transition matrix elements for photoionization. The additional laser field-induced time shifts in the exit channel are obtained from separate, time-dependent simulations of a full streaking process by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on the single-active-electron level. The resulting accurate total relative streaking time shifts between 2s and 2p emission lie well below the experimental data. We identify the presence of unresolved shake-up satellites in the experiment as a potential source of error in the determination of streaking time shifts.},

The quantum-state selectivity of the deflection is used to spatially separate molecules according to their quantum state. A detailed analysis of the deflection and the obtained quantum-state selection is presented. The rotational temperatures of the molecular beams are determined from the spatial beam profiles and are all approximately 1 K. Unprecedented degrees of laser-induced alignment ({$<$}cos2 theta2D{$>$}=0.972) and orientation of iodobenzene molecules are demonstrated when the state-selected samples are used. Such state-selected and oriented molecules provide unique possibilities for many novel experiments in chemistry and physics.},

The wavepacket was monitored via single-photon ionization, and photoelectron images measured. The images provide angle- and time-resolved data which, when obtained over a large time-window (900{$\sim$}ps), constitute a precision quantum beat spectroscopy measurement of the hyperfine state splittings. Additionally, analysis of the full photoelectron image stack provides a quantum beat imaging modality, in which the Fourier components of the photoelectron images correlated with specific beat components can be obtained. This may also permit the extraction of isotope-resolved photoelectron images in the frequency domain, in cases where nuclear spins (hence beat components) can be uniquely assigned to specific isotopes (as herein), and also provides phase information. The information content of both raw, and inverted, image stacks is investigated, suggesting the utility of the Fourier analysis methodology in cases where images cannot be inverted.},

This phase difference has an impact on harmonics from aligned polar molecules, suppressing emission from the molecules parallel to the driving laser field while favoring the perpendicular ones. For oriented molecules, we measure the amplitude ratio of even to odd harmonics produced when intense light irradiates CO molecules and determine the degree of orientation and the phase difference of attosecond bursts using molecular frame ionization and recombination amplitudes. The sensitivity of the high harmonic spectrum to subtle phase differences in the emitted radiation makes it a detailed probe of polar molecules and will drive major advances in the theory of high harmonic generation.},

In the experiment, the first strong laser pulse created a coherent rotational wave packet from an initial thermal ensemble of N2O at room temperature. The second strong laser pulse manipulated the rotational wave packet. The third weak laser pulse probed the time evolution of the rotational wave packet by measuring the time-dependent alignment parameter. The pure heterodyne alignment signal and its Fourier transform spectrum were experimentally obtained and compared with the theoretical calculations. These results illustrated that the relative populations between even and odd rotational states can be controlled in the final rotational wave packet by precisely controlling the time delay between the first and the second laser pulses.},

Using quantum effects, such as entanglement, it is often possible to do better, decreasing the error by an amount proportional to 1/n. Quantum metrology is the study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches. In this review, we analyze some of the most promising recent developments in this research field. Specifically, we deal with the developments of the theory and point out some of the new experiments. Then we look at one of the main new trends of the field, the analysis of how the theory must take into account the presence of noise and experimental imperfections.},

As with prior studies of MF reconstruction, the experimental side of this protocol is based upon time-resolved LF measurements in which a rotational wavepacket is prepared and probed as a function of time via photoionization, followed by a numerical reconstruction routine. In contrast to other methodologies, the protocol presented here does not require determination of the photoionization matrix elements, and consequently takes the relatively simple numerical form of a matrix equation. Significantly, this simplicity allows the successful reconstruction of MFPADs for nonlinear polyatomic molecules with D nh point group symmetry. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for two realistic molecular photoionization cases: N2 and C2H4. This new technique is expected to be generally applicable to a broad range of MF reconstruction problems involving photoionization of polyatomic molecules.},

Here, we provide a formalism in terms of a lab frame density matrix, which connects quantum dynamics in the molecular frame to those in the laboratory frame, providing a transparent link between computation and measurement. The formalism reveals that in any such experiment, the molecular frame dynamics vary for molecules in different orientations and that certain coherences, which are potentially experimentally accessible, are rejected by the orientation-averaged reduced vibronic density matrix. Instead, molecular angular distribution moments are introduced as a more accurate representation of experimentally accessible information. Furthermore, the formalism provides a clear definition of a molecular frame quantum tomography and specifies the requirements to perform such a measurement enabling the experimental imaging of molecular frame vibronic dynamics. Successful completion of such a measurement fully characterizes the molecular frame quantum dynamics for a molecule at any orientation in the laboratory frame.},

Phys. 2011, 44, 045603) a novel and physically interesting phenomenon was found in the field of light-matter interactions. It was shown theoretically that exposing a molecule to a laser field can give rise to the appearance of so-called light-induced conical intersections (LICIs). The existence of such LICIs may change significantly the field free physical properties of a molecular system. In this article we review the LICIs in diatomics and provide a new insight to the LICI phenomenon. The sodium dimer is chosen as an explicit sample system. We calculated the Berry phase for a contour that surrounds the point of LICI and found it to be {$\pi$}, which is the same value as for the case of a "natural" CI in triatomic or larger molecules. We also present results to stress the impact of LICIs on molecular wave packet dynamics and molecular alignment in different electronic states.},

A long, with respect to the molecular rotational periods, elliptically polarized laser pulse produces 3D alignment of the molecules, and a linearly polarized short pulse initiates torsion about the stereogenic axis. The torsional motion is monitored in real-time by measuring the dihedral angle using femtosecond time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging. Within the first 4 picoseconds (ps), torsion occurs with a period of 1.25 ps and an amplitude of 3\textdegree{} in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations. At larger times, the quantum states of the molecules describing the torsional motion dephase and an almost isotropic distribution of the dihedral angle is measured. We demonstrate an original application of covariance analysis of two-dimensional ion images to reveal strong correlations between specific ejected ionic fragments from Coulomb explosion. This technique strengthens our interpretation of the experimental data.},

With the excitation of two time-delayed, polarization-skewed pump pulses, the molecular ensemble is impulsively kicked to rotate unidirectionally, which is subsequently irradiated by another delayed probe pulse for high-order harmonic generation (HHG). The spatiotemporal evolution of the molecular rotation wave packet is visualized from the time-dependent angular distributions of the HHG yields and frequency shift measured at various polarization directions and time delays of the probe pulse. The observed frequency shift in HHG is demonstrated to arise from the nonadiabatic effect induced by molecular spinning. Different from the previous spectroscopic and Coulomb explosion imaging techniques, the angular high-harmonic spectroscopy method can reveal additionally the electronic structure and multiple orbitals of the sampled molecule. All the experimental findings are well reproduced by numerical simulations. Further extension of this method would provide a powerful tool for probing complex polyatomic molecules with HHG spectroscopy.},

By measuring the arising times of these local extrema from the time-resolved harmonic signals, the rotational temperature and pump intensity can be accurately measured. We have demonstrated our method using N2 molecules. The validity and robustness of our method are tested with different harmonic orders and by changing the gas pressures as well as the distance between the gas exit and the optical axis. Moreover, we have also demonstrated the versatility of our method by applying it to CO2 molecules.},

Following this ultrafast dynamics, however, has been an enduring endeavor. Here we demonstrate that, by using machine learning algorithm to analyze high-order harmonics generated by two-color laser pulses, we are able to retrieve the complex amplitudes and phases of harmonics of single fixed-in-space molecules. These complex dipoles enable us to construct movies of laser-driven electron migration after tunnel ionization of N2 and CO2 molecules at time steps of 50 attoseconds. Moreover, the angular dependence of the migration dynamics is fully resolved. By examining the movies, we observe that electron holes do not just migrate along the laser polarization direction, but may swirl around the atom centers. Our result establishes a general scheme for studying ultrafast electron dynamics in molecules, paving a way for further advance in tracing and controlling photochemical reactions by femtosecond lasers.},

  abstract = {Currently, our general approach to retrieve the molecular geometry from ultrafast gas-phase diffraction heavily relies on complex geometric simulations to make conclusive interpretations. In this manuscript, we develop a broadly applicable ultrafast gas-phase diffraction method that approximates the molecular frame geometry \$|\textbackslash Psi(\textbackslash mathbf\{r\}, t)|\^2\$ distribution using Bayesian Inferencing. This method does not require complex molecular dynamics simulation and can identify the unique molecular structure. We demonstrate this method's viability by retrieving the ground state geometry distribution \$|\textbackslash Psi(\textbackslash mathbf\{r\})|\^2\$ for both simulated stretched NO\$\_2\$ and measured ground state N\$\_2\$O. Due to our statistical interpretation, we retrieve a coordinate-space resolution on the order of 100\textasciitilde fm, depending on signal quality, an improvement of order 100 compared to commonly used Fourier transform based methods. By directly measuring the width of \$|\textbackslash Psi(\textbackslash mathbf\{r\})|\^2\$, this is generally only accessible through simulation, we open ultrafast gas-phase diffraction capabilities to measurements beyond current analysis approaches. Our method also leverages deterministic ensemble anisotropy; this provides an explicit dependence on the molecular frame angles. This method's ability to retrieve the unique molecular structure with high resolution, and without complex simulations, provides the potential to effectively turn gas-phase ultrafast diffraction into a discovery oriented technique, one that probes systems that are prohibitively difficult to simulate.},

  abstract = {Photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) obtained from ionization of potassium atoms using moderately intense femtosecond IR fields ({$\sim$}1012\,\,W\,cm-2) of various polarization states are shown to provide a route to ``complete'' photoionization experiments. Ionization occurs by a net three-photon absorption process, driven via the 4s\textrightarrow 4p resonance at the one-photon level. A theoretical treatment incorporating the intrapulse electronic dynamics allows for a full set of ionization matrix elements to be extracted from 2D imaging data. 3D PADs generated from the extracted matrix elements are also compared to experimental, tomographically reconstructed, 3D photoelectron distributions, providing a sensitive test of their validity. Finally, application of the determined matrix elements to ionization via more complex, polarization-shaped, pulses is demonstrated, illustrating the utility of this methodology towards detailed understanding of complex ionization control schemes and suggesting the utility of such ``multiplexed'' intrapulse processes as powerful tools for measurement.},

  abstract = {Photoelectron interferograms, manifested in photoelectron angular distributions (PADs), are high-information, coherent observables. In order to obtain the maximum information from angle-resolved photoionization experiments it is desirable to record the full, three-dimensional (3D), photoelectron momentum distribution. Here we apply tomographic reconstruction techniques to obtain such 3D distributions from multiphoton ionization of potassium atoms, and fully analyze the energy and angular content of the 3D data. The PADs obtained as a function of energy indicate good agreement with previous 2D data and detailed analysis [Hockett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 223001 (2014)] concerning the main spectral features, but also indicate unexpected symmetry breaking in certain regions of momentum space, thus revealing additional continuum interferences which cannot otherwise be observed. These observations reflect the presence of additional ionization pathways and, most generally, illustrate the power of maximum-information measurements of coherent observables for quantum metrology of complex systems.},

Particular focus is placed on a detailed example of numerical reconstruction techniques for matrix-element retrieval from time-domain experimental measurements making use of rotational-wavepackets (i.e. aligned frame measurements)\textemdash the `bootstrapping to the MF' methodology\textemdash and a matrix-inversion technique for direct MF-PAD recovery. Ongoing resources for interested researchers are also introduced, including sample data, reconstruction codes (the Photoelectron Metrology Toolkit, written in python, and associated Quantum Metrology with Photoelectrons platform/ecosystem), and literature via online repositories; it is hoped these resources will be of ongoing use to the community.},

  abstract = {The work presented in this thesis was carried out with the ultimate aim of learning about the photoionization dynamics of polyatomic molecules. This is a complex problem; in order to obtain sufficient experimental data to shed light on the dynamics careful measurement of photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) is required. Ideally these measurements are rotationally-resolved, and the angular distributions measured correspond to the formation of the molecular ion in a single rotational state. The ionization event, in the dipole approximation, can be completely described by the dipole matrix elements. If sufficient experimental data to determine the radial components of the matrix elements and associated phases, the dynamical parameters, can be obtained the photoionization experiment may be said to be complete. Analysis of such experiments requires that the initial state of the molecular system is also known, to this end resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) schemes can be used in order to populate a single quantum state prior to ionization. The experiments presented here follow this methodology, with various REMPI schemes used to prepare (pump) and ionize (probe) the molecule under study, and the velocity-map imaging (VMI) technique used to (simultaneously) record the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. Two molecules have been studied experimentally, acetylene (C2H2) and ammonia (NH3). In both cases dynamical parameters pertaining to the formation of specific states (vibronic or vibrational) of the molecular ion have been determined from experimental data. Additionally, in the ammonia work, rotationally-resolved photoelectron images were obtained.},

The experiment is performed in a supersonic jet, ensuring a relatively high number density of molecules with moderately low rotational temperature. The effect is optically probed on a femtosecond time scale by the use of a third short pulse, enabling a time-resolved birefringence detection performed successively in two perpendicular planes of the laboratory frame. The technique allows for an unambiguous estimation of the molecular planar delocalization produced within the polarization plane of the pulse pair after the turn-off of the field. The measurements are supported by numerical simulations which lead to the quantification of the observed effect and provide more physical insights into the phenomenon.},

Accordingly, many different participants need insight into how to understand the relationship between software, its development, its use, and its scientific impact. In this article, we draw on interviews and participant observation to describe the information needs of domain scientists, software component producers, infrastructure providers, and ecosystem stewards, including science funders. We provide a framework by which to categorize different types of measures and their relationships as they reach around from funding, development, scientific use, and through to scientific impact. We use this framework to organize a presentation of existing measures and techniques, and to identify areas in which techniques are either not widespread, or are entirely missing. We conclude with policy recommendations designed to improve insight into the scientific software ecosystem, make it more understandable, and thereby contribute to the progress of science.},

Using Coulomb Explosion Imaging, we have shot the first high-resolution molecular movie of a to and fro isomerization process in the acetylene cation. So far, this kind of phenomenon could only be observed using vacuum ultraviolet light from a free-electron laser. Here we show that 266 nm ultrashort laser pulses are capable of initiating rich dynamics through multiphoton ionization. With our generally applicable tabletop approach that can be used for other small organic molecules, we have investigated two basic chemical reactions simultaneously: proton migration and C=C bond breaking, triggered by multiphoton ionization. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the timescales and relaxation pathways predicted by new and quantitative ab initio trajectory simulations.},

When neutral NO molecules are partly ionized in intense laser fields (I(0) {$>$} 35 TW/cm(2)), a hole in the rotational wave packet of the remaining neutral NO is created because of the ionization rate depending on the alignment angle of the molecular axis with respect to the laser polarization direction. Rotational state distributions of NO are experimentally observed, and then the characteristic feature that the population at higher J levels is increased by the ionization can be identified. Numerical calculation for solving time-dependent rotational Schr\"odinger equations including the effect of the ionization is carried out. The numerical results suggest that NO molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization direction are dominantly ionized at the peak intensity of I(0) = 42 TW/cm(2), where the multiphoton ionization is preferred rather than the tunneling ionization.},

Several examples are given to illustrate the build up to a complete calculation. Finally, we measure the performance of our library against that of current implementations.

  abstract = {Automatic detection of point groups as well as symmetrisation of molecular geometry and wavefunctions are useful tools in computational quantum chemistry. Algorithms for developing these tools as well as an implementation are presented. The symmetry detection algorithm is a clustering algorithm for symmetry invariant properties, combined with logical deduction of possible symmetry elements using the geometry of sets of symmetrically equivalent atoms. An algorithm for determining the symmetry adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of atomic orbitals is also presented. The SALCs are constructed with the use of projection operators for the irreducible representations, as well as subgroups for determining splitting fields for a canonical basis. The character tables for the point groups are auto generated, and the algorithm is described. Symmetrisation of molecules use a projection into the totally symmetric space, whereas for wavefunctions projection as well and partner function determination and averaging is used. The software has been released as a stand-alone, open source library under the MIT license and integrated into both computational and molecular modelling software.Graphical abstract.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Here we present the direct experimental recording of very-high-resolution and -fidelity molecular movies over more than one-and-a-half periods of the laser-induced rotational dynamics of carbonylsulfide (OCS) molecules. Utilising the combination of single quantum-state selection and an optimised two-pulse sequence to create a tailored rotational wavepacket, an unprecedented degree of field-free alignment, {$\langle$}cos2\texttheta 2D{$\rangle$}\,=\,0.96 ({$\langle$}cos2\texttheta{$\rangle$}\,=\,0.94) is achieved, exceeding the theoretical limit for single-pulse alignment. The very rich experimentally observed quantum dynamics is fully recovered by the angular probability distribution obtained from solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with parameters refined against the experiment. The populations and phases of rotational states in the retrieved time-dependent three-dimensional wavepacket rationalises the observed very high degree of alignment.},

Here, we show that x-ray photoelectron diffraction\textemdash where a photoelectron emitted after x-ray absorption illuminates the molecular structure from within\textemdash can be used to image the increase of the internuclear distance during the x-ray-induced fragmentation of an O2 molecule. By measuring the molecular-frame photoelectron emission patterns for a two-photon sequential K-shell ionization in coincidence with the fragment ions, and by sorting the data as a function of the measured kinetic energy release, we can resolve the elongation of the molecular bond by approximately 1.2 a.u. within the duration of the x-ray pulse.

  abstract = {So-called perfect or complete scattering experiments in atomic and molecular physics have extensively been carried out applying polarized interacting particles and/or coincidence techniques in order to detect the resulting particles. The description of scattering amplitudes and their relevant phases can be referred to Ben Bederson's (New York) initial papers at the end of the sixties and beginning of the seventies. In his analysis of theoretical and experimental data, Fano's work of 1957 resulted already in a physical picture, which related scattering amplitudes to state multipoles of excited atoms, e.g., orientation and alignment. The article starts with Perfect Scattering Experiments in atomic collisions, including special topics in the areas of electronic, ionic, atomic collisions and photoionization processes. These examples of special topics do not restrict the striking enormous consequences for the advancement of physics as initially introduced by Ben Bederson. Angle and spin resolved experiments and theory, and their analysis will be discussed with a particular emphasis on electron emission processes. This will be illustrated for the resonantly excited Auger decay of argon atoms. For the generation of the intermediate excited Rydberg state two different mechanisms, photoexcitation and electron impact excitation, will be considered. Main ideas of complete experiments for the Auger decay are presented together with selected results obtained in this comparatively new field of research. In a subsequent chapter, a selection of fundamental achievements connected to perfect scattering processes within molecules have been described.},

  abstract = {The angular momentum of molecules, or, equivalently, their rotation in three-dimensional space, is ideally suited for quantum control. Molecular angular momentum is naturally quantized, time evolution is governed by a well-known Hamiltonian with only a few accurately known parameters, and transitions between rotational levels can be driven by external fields from various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Control over the rotational motion can be exerted in one-, two-, and many-body scenarios, thereby allowing one to probe Anderson localization, target stereoselectivity of bimolecular reactions, or encode quantum information to name just a few examples. The corresponding approaches to quantum control are pursued within separate, and typically disjoint, subfields of physics, including ultrafast science, cold collisions, ultracold gases, quantum information science, and condensed-matter physics. It is the purpose of this review to present the various control phenomena, which all rely on the same underlying physics, within a unified framework. To this end, recall the Hamiltonian for free rotations, assuming the rigid rotor approximation to be valid, and summarize the different ways for a rotor to interact with external electromagnetic fields. These interactions can be exploited for control-from achieving alignment, orientation, or laser cooling in a one-body framework, steering bimolecular collisions, or realizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator in the many-body setting.},

  abstract = {Attosecond science is based on electron dynamics driven by a strong optical electric field and has evolved beyond its original scope in gas-phase atomic and molecular physics to solid-state targets. In this review, we discuss a nanoscale attosecond physics laboratory that has enabled the first observations of strong-field-driven photoemission and recollision at a solid surface: laser-triggered metallic nanotips. In addition to the research questions of rather fundamental nature, femtosecond electron sources with outstanding beam qualities have resulted from this research, which has prompted follow-up application in the sensing of electric fields and lightwave electronics, ultrafast microscopy and diffraction, and fundamental matter-wave quantum optics. We review the theoretical and experimental concepts underlying near-field enhancement, photoemission regimes and electron acceleration mechanisms. Nanotips add new degrees of freedom to well known strong-field phenomena from atomic physics. For example, they enable the realization of a true sub-optical-cycle acceleration regime where recollision is suppressed. We also discuss the possibility of high-harmonic generation due to laser irradiation of metallic nanostructures.},

  abstract = {A potential energy surface (PES) for high-energy collisions between nitrogen molecules is useful for modeling chemical dynamics in shock waves and plasmas. In the present work, we fit the many-body (MB) component of the ground-state PES of N4 to an analytic function using neural networks (NNs) with permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs). The fitting dataset of the N4 system is an extension of one used previously, extended with 4859 new CASPT2 points and 13 new CCSD(T) points to reach a total of 21\,406 points. The MB-PIP-NN fit required a very complete coverage of the geometry domain in order to get a physical fit, and we devised several tactical steps to achieve this, including trajectory calculations, the comparison of the NN fit with PIP fits with mixed-exponential Gaussian bond order variables, and searching geometry regions with sparse data coverage. With these efforts, the final dataset is more suitable for a NN fit. The energy range of the dataset is much wider than those used in other systems previously fitted by NNs, and there are more rugged surface regions than usual due to locally avoided crossings. The performance of the new MB-PIP-NN fit is compared to that of another new fit to the same data by least-squares methods not employing NNs, and the mean unsigned deviation from the electronic structure calculations is reduced by a factor of 3, although the computing time to calculate a force for a trajectory calculation is larger by an order of magnitude. The accuracy achievable with the NN fit for this difficult system is very impressive, and we anticipate that the NN method can give useful fits to difficult cases that cannot be achieved by more conventional methods.},

  abstract = {Laser induced field-free alignment of linear molecules is investigated by using a single-shot spatial imaging technique. The measurements are achieved by femtosecond time-resolved optical polarigraphy (FTOP). Individual alignment revivals recorded at high resolution in CO2, as well as simultaneous observation of several alignment revivals produced within the rotational period of the O2 molecule are reported. The data are analyzed with a theoretical model describing the alignment experienced by each molecule standing within the interaction region observed by the detector. The temporal dynamics, intensity dependence, and degree of alignment are measured and compared with the awaited results. The technique is simple and can be easily implemented in a large class of molecular samples. Improvement to extend the performance of the method is discussed. The reported study is a decisive step toward feedback optimization and optimal control of field-free molecular alignment.},

  abstract = {A machine-learning based approach for evaluating potential energies for quantum mechanical studies of properties of the ground and excited vibrational states of small molecules is developed. This approach uses the molecular-orbital-based machine learning (MOB-ML) method to generate electronic energies with the accuracy of CCSD(T) calculations at the same cost as a Hartree\textendash Fock calculation. To further reduce the computational cost of the potential energy evaluations without sacrificing the CCSD(T) level accuracy, GPU-accelerated Neural Network Potential Energy Surfaces (NN-PES) are trained to geometries and energies that are collected from small-scale Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations, which are run using energies evaluated using the MOB-ML model. The combined NN+(MOB-ML) approach is used in variational calculations of the ground and low-lying vibrational excited states of water and in DMC calculations of the ground states of water, CH5+, and its deuterated analogues. For both of these molecules, comparisons are made to the results obtained using potentials that were fit to much larger sets of electronic energies than were required to train the MOB-ML models. The NN+(MOB-ML) approach is also used to obtain a potential surface for C2H5+, which is a carbocation with a nonclassical equilibrium structure for which there is currently no available potential surface. This potential is used to explore the CH stretching vibrations, focusing on those of the bridging hydrogen atom. For both CH5+ and C2H5+ the MOB-ML model is trained using geometries that were sampled from an AIMD trajectory, which was run at 350 K. By comparison, the structures sampled in the ground state calculations can have energies that are as much as ten times larger than those used to train the MOB-ML model. For water a higher temperature AIMD trajectory is needed to obtain accurate results due to the smaller thermal energy. A second MOB-ML model for C2H5+ was developed with additional higher energy structures in the training set. The two models are found to provide nearly identical descriptions of the ground state of C2H5+.}

In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation of the remaining H+2 fragment shows no symmetry with respect to the ionic H+ and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric H+2 states that is caused by autoionization.

  abstract = {The extension of laser cooling and trapping techniques from atoms to molecules is currently the subject of intense and growing interest. Molecular laser cooling and trapping offers a general technique applicable to a variety of molecules with different properties and internal structures and is well-suited to the growing list of proposed applications for ultracold molecules. The recent development of optical cycling schemes for specific molecular species now allow each molecule to scatter up to {$\sim$}106 photons. This has proven sufficient for multiple groups to laser cool and slow molecular beams and, notably, capture molecules in magneto-optical traps (MOTs) and cool them to ultracold temperatures. MOTs are the workhorse technique for atomic physics in the ultracold regime and today's molecular MOTs represent a powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. This Topical Review presents a summary of the progress made in this new and emerging field.},

  abstract = {A new implementation of pump-probe polarization spectroscopy is presented where the revivals of an impulsively excited rotational wavepacket are mapped onto a broad-band, chirped continuum pulse to measure a long temporal window without the need for delay scanning. Experimental measurements and a theoretical framework for spectral-temporal amplitude mapping polarization spectroscopy (STAMPS) as applied to impulsive rotational motion are presented. In this technique, a femtosecond laser pulse is used to prepare a rotational wavepacket in a gas-phase sample at room temperature. The rotational revivals of the wavepacket are then mapped onto a chirped continuum (400-800 nm) pulse created by laser filamentation in argon. Nearly single-shot time-resolved rotational spectra are recorded over a 65 ps time window. The transient birefringence spectra are simulated by including terms for polarization rotation of the probe as well as cross-phase modulation. Measurements and simulations are presented for the cylindrically symmetric N2, O2, and CO2 molecules. The long time window of the method allows measurement of rotational spectra for asymmetric top molecules, and here we present measurements for ethylene and methanol.},

  abstract = {Experiments in the gas phase usually involve averaging observables over a random molecular axis alignment distribution. This deleterious averaging limits insights gained by probes of molecular dynamics, but can be overcome by prealigning molecular axes using laser-alignment methods. However, the transformation from the laboratory frame to the molecular frame of reference requires quantitative knowledge of the axis alignment distribution. The latter is often hard to obtain directly from experimental data, particularly for polyatomic molecules. Here we describe a general maximum-likelihood classification procedure for non-adiabatic numerical alignment simulations with free parameters that employs experimental data from an alignment-dependent probe. This method delivers (i) the most probable molecular frame angular dependence of the probe, and (ii) the most likely laboratory frame axis alignment distribution of the sample, each with a confidence interval. This procedure was recently used for studies of angle- and channel-resolved strong field ionization of 1,3-butadiene in the molecular frame [Mikosch et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 023004 (2013)], used here as an illustrative example.},

The method exploits both energy and time-domain spectroscopic data, and yields the lab frame density matrix (LFDM) for the system, the elements of which are populations and coherences fully characterising the electronic and vibrational dynamics in the molecular frame. Beyond characterizing the system, time and orientation angle dependent expectation values of any relevant operator may be constructed using the LFDM. For example, the time-dependent molecular frame electronic probability density may be constructed, yielding information on charge flow in the molecular frame, and entanglement within the system can be determined. In general MFQT provides new routes to the study of ultrafast molecular dynamics, information processing, metrology and optimal control schemes.},

Thus, three recoil-ion momentum components, the recoil-ion charge state and three momentum components of one electron emitted in any collision-induced ionization reaction are measured simultaneously with a coincidence efficiency of 28\%. In order to accept large recoil-ion longitudinal momenta (along the beam) of pR{$\Vert$} {$\leq$} 160 a.u. and simultaneously guarantee a superior resolution in this direction ({$\Delta$} PR{$\Vert$} {$\leq$} {$\pm$} 0.08 a.u.), recoil ions are extracted in the longitudinal direction different from all former concepts. Test measurements, details on the present design and results of a kinematically complete experiment for single ionization are presented and possible further improvements are discussed. The future potential of such spectrometers for the investigation of collision-induced atomic many-particle reactions, the ``Coulomb-explosion'' of molecules and the spectroscopy of electronic states in heavy few-electron systems is illustrated.

Here, we present such an approach that uses the permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) method to fit high-dimensional PESs. The approach is represented by a simple equation, in obvious notation VLL\textrightarrow CC = VLL + {$\Delta$}VCC\textendash LL, and demonstrated for CH4, H3O+, and trans and cis-N-methyl acetamide (NMA), CH3CONHCH3. For these molecules, the LL PES, VLL, is a PIP fit to DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d) energies and gradients and {$\Delta$}VCC\textendash LL is a precise PIP fit obtained using a low-order PIP basis set and based on a relatively small number of CCSD(T) energies. For CH4, these are new calculations adopting an aug-cc-pVDZ basis, for H3O+, previous CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVQZ energies are used, while for NMA, new CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations are performed. With as few as 200 CCSD(T) energies, the new PESs are in excellent agreement with benchmark CCSD(T) results for the small molecules, and for 12-atom NMA, training is done with 4696 CCSD(T) energies.},

This topic, driven by intense experimental and theoretical efforts, has been ever growing and developed for more than 20 years, and laser-induced alignment methods are used routinely in a number of applications in physics and chemistry. Starting in 2013, we have demonstrated that laser-induced alignment also applies to molecules dissolved in helium nanodroplets. Here we present an overview of this new work discussing alignment in both the nonadiabatic (short-pulse) and adiabatic (long-pulse) limit. We show how femtosecond or picosecond pulses can set molecules into coherent rotation that lasts for a long time and reflects the rotational structure of the helium-solvated molecules, provided the pulses are weak or, conversely, results in desolvation of the molecules when the pulses are strong. For long pulses we show that the 0.4~K temperature of the droplets, shared with the molecules or molecular complexes, leads to exceptionally high degrees of alignment. Upon rapid truncation of the laser pulse, the strong alignment can be made effectively field-free, lasting for about 10 ps thanks to slowing of molecular rotation by the helium environment. Finally, we discuss how the combination of strongly aligned molecular dimers and laser-induced Coulomb explosion imaging enables determination of the structure of the dimers. As a background and reference point, the first third of the article introduces some of the central concepts of laser-induced alignment for isolated molecules, illustrated by numerical and experimental examples.},

WPI is a fundamental and versatile scenario used to control a variety of quantum systems with a sequence of short laser pulses whose relative phase is finely adjusted to control the interference of electronic or nuclear wave packets (WPs). It is also useful in retrieving quantum information such as the amplitudes and phases of eigenfunctions superposed to generate a WP. Experimental and theoretical efforts to retrieve both the amplitude and phase information are recounted. This review also discusses information processing based on the eigenfunctions of atoms and molecules as one of the modern and future applications of coherent control. The ultrafast coherent control of ultracold atoms and molecules and the coherent control of complex systems are briefly discussed as future perspectives.},

Highly accurate, full-dimensional variational calculations provide a basis of field-free rovibrational states for evaluating the rovibrational matrix elements of high-rank Cartesian tensor operators and for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The effect of the external electric field is treated as a multipole moment expansion truncated at the second hyperpolarizability interaction term. Our fully numerical and computationally efficient method has been implemented in a new program, RichMol, which can simulate the effects of multiple external fields of arbitrary strength, polarization, pulse shape, and duration. Illustrative calculations of two-color orientation and rotational excitation with an optical centrifuge of NH3 are discussed.},

In addition to the simulations, we develop a simple model which qualitatively describes the shape and amplitude of post-pulse alignment induced by a laser pulse of moderate power density. In our treatment we take into account that molecules in rotationally excited states can interact with a laser pulse not only by absorbing energy but also by stimulated emission. The extent to which these processes are present in the interaction depends, on the one hand, on the directionality of the molecular angular momentum (given by the M quantum number), and on the other hand on the ratio of transition frequencies and pulse duration (determined by the J number). A rotational wave packet created by a strong pulse from an initially pure state contains a broad range of rotational levels, over which the character of the interaction can change from non-adiabatic to adiabatic. Depending on the laser pulse duration and amplitude, the transition from the non-adiabatic to the adiabatic limit proceeds through a region with dominant rotational heating, or alignment, for short pulses and a large region with rotational cooling, and correspondingly preferred anti-alignment, for longer pulses.},

Experimentally we use time-resolved photofragment imaging to measure the alignment of two molecules with different asymmetry, iodobenzene, and iodopentafluorobenzene. Our numerical results explain the experimental observations and generalize them to other molecules. The rotational revival structure of asymmetric tops differs qualitatively from the intensively studied linear top case. Potentially it provides valuable structural information about molecules.},

  abstract = {One contribution of 14 to a theme issue 'Modern theoretical chemistry'. A rationale for creating highly aligned distributions of molecules is that it enables vector properties referenced to molecule-fixed axes (the molecular frame) to be determined. In the present work, the degree of alignment that is necessary for this to be achieved in practice is explored. Alignment is commonly parametrized in experiments by a single parameter, cos 2 \texttheta{} , which is insufficient to enable predictive calculations to be performed. Here, it is shown that, if the full distribution of molecular axes takes a Gaussian form, this single parameter can be used to determine the complete set of alignment moments needed to characterize the distribution. In order to demonstrate the degree of alignment that is required to approach the molecular frame, the alignment moments corresponding to a few chosen values of cos 2 \texttheta{} are used to project a model molecular frame photoelectron angular distribution into the laboratory frame. These calculations show that cos 2 \texttheta{} needs to approach 0.9 in order to avoid significant blurring to be caused by averaging. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modern theoretical chemistry'.},

Here we report on the identification of two prominent examples, interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) and radiative charge transfer (RCT), which are induced in argon dimers by electron collisions. After initial ionization of one dimer constituent ICD and RCT lead to the ionization of its neighbour either by energy transfer to or by electron transfer from the neighbour, respectively. By full quintuple-coincidence measurements, we unambiguously identify ICD and RCT, and trace the relaxation dynamics as function of the collisional excited state energies. Such interatomic processes multiply the number of electrons and shift their energies down to the critical 1\textendash 10\,eV range, which can efficiently cause chemical degradation of biomolecules. Therefore, the observed relaxation channels might contribute to cause efficient radiation damage in biological systems.},

  abstract = {Cell and gene damage caused by ionizing radiation has been studied for many years. It is accepted that DNA lesions (single- and double-strand breaks, for example) are induced by secondary species such as radicals, ions and the abundant low-energy secondary electrons generated by the primary radiation. Particularly harmful are dense ionization clusters of several ionization processes within a volume typical for the biomolecular system. Here we report the observation of a damage mechanism in the form of a non-local autoionizing process called intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). It directly involves DNA constituents or other organic molecules in an aqueous environment. The products are two energetic ions and three reactive secondary electrons that can cause further damage in their vicinity. Hydrogen-bonded complexes that consist of one tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecule\textemdash a surrogate of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone\textemdash and one water molecule are used as a model system. After electron impact ionization of the water molecule in the inner-valence shell the vacancy is filled by an outer-valence electron. The released energy is transferred across the hydrogen bridge and leads to ionization of the neighbouring THF molecule. This energy transfer from water to THF is faster than the otherwise occurring intermolecular proton transfer. The signature of the ICD reaction is identified in triple-coincidence measurements of both ions and one of the final state electrons. These results could improve the understanding of radiation damage in biological tissue.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of impulsive alignment of CO2 molecules produced through their interaction with a nonresonant, strong laser pulse. The periodic alignment is monitored using a polarization technique generally employed in optical Kerr effect experiments; the birefringence produced by alignment of the molecular sample is measured with a weak pulse, time-delayed with respect to the alignment pulse. The technique provides a signal proportional to {$\langle$}cos2 \texttheta{$\rangle-$}1/3, where \texttheta{} is the polar angle between the molecular axis and the strong-field polarization axis. Experiments are conducted at room and at low temperatures. Two methods of analysis are presented. The first one consists in comparing the signal with the prediction of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. From a fine analysis of the temporal signal shape one can then deduce the value of {$\langle$}cos2 \texttheta{$\rangle$}. The second one allows us to extract {$\langle$}cos2 \texttheta{$\rangle$} through a calibration of the birefringence signal obtained by performing the experiment in a reference atomic gas sample. Both analyses are compared and found in good agreement for the different laser intensities investigated. Saturation of the alignment process is observed at a laser intensity that agrees with the ionization saturation intensities of CO2.},

Previous studies are indicative that the motion of the ejected electron is dominated by the monopole term of the electron-molecular ion potential expanded about the molecular center of mass when the ratio of the orbital velocity of the bound electron to the velocity of the ejected electron is smaller than about 1:2. Thus the motion of the ejected electron appears to be approaching the limit of motion in a spherically symmetric, screened Coulomb potential. At this limit, {$\beta$} has a form particularly easy to evaluate. We replace the screened Coulomb potential by the Coulomb potential itself, of strength Z, where Z is taken to be an adjustable parameter. We present arguments to justify this approximation based on the condition that at high energies the photoelectric conversion occurs most efficiently in the imme...},

  abstract = {We study and demonstrate the rephasing property of the echo response in a multilevel rotational system of iodomethane via long time-resolved optical birefringence measurements. The strong centrifugal distortion of iodomethane is utilized as a dephasing mechanism imprinted on the echo signal and is shown to rephase throughout its evolution. The dependence of the echo signal amplitude on the driving pulses' intensities is theoretically and experimentally explored. The analogy to Hahn's spin echoes is discussed, and a quantum-mechanical version of Hahn's track runners is provided for the case of multilevel rotational system. S ince its first demonstration by E. L. Hahn in NMR 1 in 1950 and its adoption in optics 2 in 1964, the phenomenon of echoes has been realized and utilized in a wide range of imaging and spectroscopic applications such as 2D electronic, 3-5 vibrational, 6-9 and rotational spectroscopy. 10-13 Their ability to distinguish between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening has made echo experiments highly important in modern nonlinear spectroscopy and imaging. 14 Whereas echo experiments are typically treated in the quantum-mechanical framework of molecular degrees of freedom, the underlying physics of the echo phenomenon was beautifully described using classical physics and experimentally demonstrated in a series of works recently. 10-12},

  abstract = {We document recent progress made in the development and deployment of a science gateway for atomic and molecular physics (AMP) [10]. The molecular scattering applications supported in the gateway and the early phase of the project were described in a preliminary report [33]. Here, we present recent advances in both the platform's capabilities and in its adoption for additional software suites and new possibilities for further development. The past year has seen substantial progress, with the addition of two new software suites and additional authors. A very successful workshop, supported by the MOLSSI, NSF, and NIST, was held at NIST from Dec 11-13, 2019. The agenda contained discussions of the science as well as demonstrations of the codes both in production and learning modes. More than 30 scientists participated in the workshop. Over the past few months, the number of registered gateway users has grown to over 60. The applications being deployed provide users with a number of state-of-the-art computational techniques to treat electron scattering from atomic and molecular targets, as well as the interaction of radiation with such systems. One may view all of these approaches as generalized close-coupling methods, where the inclusion of electron correlation is accomplished via the addition of generalized pseudostates. A number of the methods can also be employed to compute high-quality bound-state wave functions by closing the channels and imposing exponentially decaying boundary conditions. The application software suites are deployed on a number of NSF and DoE supercomputing systems. These deployments are brought to the user community through the science gateway with user interfaces, post-processing, and visualization tools. Below we outline our efforts in deploying the Django web framework for the AMPGateway using the Apache Airavata gateway middleware, discuss the new advanced capabilities available, and provide an outlook for future directions for the gateway and the AMP community.},

  abstract = {We review the theory of intense laser alignment of molecules and present a survey of the many recent developments in this rapidly evolving field. Starting with a qualitative discussion that emphasizes the physical mechanism responsible for laser alignment, we proceed with a detailed exposition of the underlying theory, focusing on aspects that have not been presented in the past. Application of the theory in several pedagogical illustrations is then followed by a review of the recent experimental and theoretical advances in the field. We conclude with a discussion of new directions, future opportunities, and areas where we expect intense laser alignment to play a role in the future. Throughout we emphasize the recent evolution of the method of nonadiabatic alignment from isolated diatomic molecules to complex media.},

  abstract = {The angular distributions of 1so-photoelectrons from N2 molecules held fixed in space have been measured around the or* shape resonance for the first time, The angular distributions have been very rich in structure, which are completely different from usual photoelectron angular distributions from randomly oriented molecules, as predicted by Dill. The orbital angular momentum properties of the 1scr photoelectrons around the o. * shape resonance have been made clear from the angular distribution patterns. PACS numbers: 33.80.Eh, 33.90.+h Molecular K-shell spectra are known to depart remark-ably from corresponding atomic spectra [1]. Specifically, above the K edge there is a broad band of enhanced pho-toabsorption in place of the smooth monotonic decrease one might expect. The novel feature, so called shape res-onance, results from the interaction between the photo-electron escaping from the K shell and the anisotropic molecular field [2]. Direct study of the orbital angular momentum properties of the photoelectrons in the shape resonance is not pos-sible by conventional gas-phase photoelectron angular distribution studies, owing to the random orientations of the molecules. If, however, the molecules have a definite orientation, the angular distributions of photoelectrons ejected by the electric-dipole interaction has the general form [3] 2\textasciitilde max g \textasciitilde KM' KM(0 tt') @=0 M where the angles (0, tb) are measured from the molecule g axis, I " is the maximum orbital angular momentum component of the outgoing photoelectron, and Y\textasciitilde M are the spherical harmonics. Thus, such photoelectron angular distributions of fixed-in-space molecules can offer a direct probe of the orbital angular momentum composition of the molecular photoelectrons. In the limited case, the angular distribution of photoelectrons from oriented H2 [4], CO [5], and N2 and CO [6] molecules were predicted by three groups. The present experiment has been undertaken to study the orbital angular momentum properties of the photo-electrons in a prototype molecular shape resonance \textemdash{} the o. * shape resonance of nitrogen molecules. In this Let-ter, we present the first experimental results on the an-gular distributions of lsd-photoelectrons ejected from Nz molecules held fixed in space. The photoionization pro-cesses of fixed-in-space molecules in a gas phase can be realized by detecting photoelectrons in coincidence with fragment ions as reported by Golovin et al. [7,8]. Since the dissociation time of the molecular ions produced by a subsequent Auger decay of the K-shell vacancy is much shorter than the molecular rotation period, the emission direction of the fragment ion is considered to be equiva-lent to the molecular orientation at a moment of absorp-tion of a photon. The experiments have been carried out on beam line BL-28, supplying the synchrotron radiation emitted from an undulator [9] inserted in the 2.5 GeV positron stor-age ring at the Photon Factory. The undulator radia-tion, monochromatized with a 10 m grazing incidence monochromator [10], was focused onto an effusive beam of the sample gas at the center of the ionization region of the experimental chamber. The entrance and exit slit openings of the monochromator were both set to 50 p, m. The expected energy resolution was about 0.6 eV at h p = 400 eV. The diameter of the photon beam spot at the sam-ple position was less than 0.2 mm. The first harmonic of the undulator radiation was used for all measurements de-scribed here. It had been confirmed in our previous work that the degree of linear polarization within the first har-monic peak of the undulator radiation is more than 95\% [11]. Two identical ion detectors (channeltrons) with re-tarding grids were installed in the chamber at 0 and 90 relative to the polarization vector of the incident radiation in the plane perpendicular to the radiation path. A re-tarding potential of +3 V was applied to the grid of each detector to select energetic fragment ions only. Each de-tector has a collection half-angle of 10.5 . A parallel plate electrostatic analyzer with a position sensitive detector (a microchannel plate and a resistive anode), which can be rotated around the photon beam axis, was used to energy analyze photoelectrons [11]. The effective acceptance an-gle of the analyzer was estimated to be \textasciitilde 5 . To obtain coincidence signals between photoelectrons and fragment ions, event signals from the electron detector were fed into two time-to-amplitude cogverters to start them at the same time, and signals from one ion detector were used to stop one of the converters and signals from the other detector to stop the other. As demonstrated in our previous work [11 \textemdash{} 19], the en-ergetic fragment-ion angular distributions after the K-shell excitations of diatomic molecules induced by linearly polarized radiation have enabled us to decompose the conventional photoabsorption spectra into their molecular 0031-9007/95/74(3)/359(4)\$06. 00 1995 The American Physical Society 359},

The CO molecule is used as a computational example. While the hyperpolarizability mechanism generates small amounts of orientation at intensities below the ionization threshold, ionization depletion quickly becomes the dominant mechanism as soon as ionizing intensities are reached. Only the ionization mechanism leads to substantial orientation (e.g., on the order of {$\langle$}cos⁡\texttheta{$\rangle\greaterequivlnt$}0.1). For intensities typical of laser-induced molecular alignment and orientation experiments, the two mechanisms lead to robust, characteristic timings of the field-free orientation wave-packet revivals relative to the alignment revivals and the revival time. The revival timings can be used to detect the active orientation mechanism experimentally.},

Here we show how to extract full body-frame high harmonic generation information for molecules with more complicated geometries by utilizing the methods of coherent transient rotational spectroscopy. To demonstrate this approach, we obtain the relative strength of harmonic emission along the three principal axes in the asymmetric-top sulphur dioxide.

  abstract = {High-order harmonic spectroscopy (HHS), as an emerging technique, provides a way to detect molecular structures with \aa ngstr\"om spatial resolution and ultrafast electron dynamics in molecules on an attosecond timescale. However, the implementation of HHS still encounters great difficulties due to the coherent average of single-molecule emissions from different alignment angles. Here, we provide a machine learning algorithm based on the iterative projection method to fully retrieve the complex single-molecule dipole of a linear molecule from the harmonic spectra measured at different delays and polarization angles between the alignment and driving pulses. We demonstrated our algorithm both theoretically and experimentally using the N2 molecule. The results show that our algorithm can accurately retrieve the complex single-molecule dipole from the harmonic spectra with good noise stability and robustness. From the retrieved single-molecule dipole, the contributions of multiple orbitals in high harmonic generation are identified even with a low degree of alignment.},

The transition dipoles and phase shifts thus determined are in reasonable agreement with those by state-to-state photoionization experiment and Schwinger variational calculations. The difference of the phase shifts from those expected from the quantum defects of Rydberg states suggests occurrence of weak hybridization of different l-waves, in addition to the well-known s-d super complex.

  abstract = {Several recent studies have demonstrated how well-suited femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectra are for mapping wavepacket dynamics in molecular systems. Theoretical studies of femtosecond photoelectron spectra which incorporate a robust description of the underlying photoionization dynamics should enhance the utility of such spectra as a probe of wavepackets and of the evolution of electronic structure. This should be particularly true in regions of avoided crossings where the photoionization amplitudes and electronic structure may evolve rapidly with geometry. In this paper we present the results of studies of energy- and angle-resolved femtosecond photoelectron spectra for wavepackets in the diatomic systems, Na2 and NaI. Both cases involve motion through regions of avoided crossings. In Na2, however, wavepacket motion occurs on a single adiabatic potential with an inner and outer well and a barrier between them, while in NaI wavepackets move on the nonadiabatically coupled covalent (NaI) and ionic (Na+I-) potentials. Results of these studies will be used to illustrate the insight into wavepacket dynamics that time-resolved photoelectron spectra provide. For example, in the case of NaI these angle-resolved photoelectron spectra seem to offer some promise for probing real-time dynamics of intramolecular electron transfer occurring in the crossing region of the ionic and covalent states.},

Our data show that the transition dipoles for single-photon ionization of N2 and CO2 at 43 eV have larger perpendicular components than parallel ones. A direct comparison with published theoretical partial wave ionization cross-sections confirms these experimental observations, which are the first results to allow such comparison with theory for bound cation states.

Experimentally, the RFPADs were obtained using the vector correlation approach applied to the dissociative photoionization (DPI) involving these molecular ionic states. The polar and azimuthal angle dependences of the photoelectron angular distributions are measured relative to the reference frame provided by the ion recoil axis and direction of polarization of the linearly polarized light. Experimental results are reported for the photon excitation energies hnu=14.4 and 22.0 eV. Theoretically the authors give expressions for both the MFPAD and the RFPAD. They show that the functional form in the recoil frame, where an average over the azimuthal dependence of the molecular fragments about the recoil direction is made, is identical to that they have earlier found for the DPI experiments performed on linear molecules. MFPADs were then computed using single-center expansion techniques within the fixed-nuclei frozen-core Hartree-Fock approximation. The computed cross sections for ionization to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state show a strong propensity for ionization with the polarization of the light perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, whereas the ionization to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state of the ion is of similar intensity for all orientations of the polarization of the light in the molecular frame. These qualitative features of the MFPAD are also evident in the RFPAD. The RFPAD for ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state is strongly peaked in the perpendicular orientation, whereas the RFPAD for ionization leading to the (4a2)-1 3A1 state is much more nearly isotropic. Comparison between experimental and theoretical RFPADs indicates that the recoil angle for NO+ fragments is approximately 50 degrees relative to the symmetry axis of the initial C2v symmetry of the NO2 molecule in the ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state and the recoil angle is approximately 120 degrees for the O+ fragment for ionization leading to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state.},

The authors find that excitation with a single amplitude shaped femtosecond pulse allows the direct observation of up to a six photon absorption, which generates a coherent superposition of 13 rotational states. The multilevel rotational wave packet is theoretically treated with the multipole moment formalism in order to characterize the experimentally observed time-dependent alignment.

In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection - imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity-map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection. In this Perspective, we review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, provide examples of their implementation in a range of different experimental contexts, and discuss potential future developments and applications.},

Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave.},

  abstract = {The multiphoton multichannel photodynamics of NO(2) has been studied using femtosecond time-resolved coincidence imaging. A novel photoelectron-photoion coincidence imaging machine was developed at the laboratory in Amsterdam employing velocity map imaging and "slow" charged particle extraction using additional electron and ion optics. The NO(2) photodynamics was studied using a two color pump-probe scheme with femtosecond pulses at 400 and 266 nm. The multiphoton excitation produces both NO(2) (+) parent ions and NO(+) fragment ions. Here we mainly present the time dependent photoelectron images in coincidence with NO(2) (+) or NO(+) and the (NO(+),e) photoelectron versus fragment ion kinetic energy correlations. The coincidence photoelectron spectra and the correlated energy distributions make it possible to assign the different dissociation pathways involved. Nonadiabatic dynamics between the ground state and the A (2)B(2) state after absorption of a 400 nm photon is reflected in the transient photoelectron spectrum of the NO(2) (+) parent ion. Furthermore, Rydberg states are believed to be used as "stepping" states responsible for the rather narrow and well-separated photoelectron spectra in the NO(2) (+) parent ion. Slow statistical and fast direct fragmentation of NO(2) (+) after prompt photoelectron ejection is observed leading to formation of NO(+)+O. Fragmentation from both the ground state and the electronically excited a (3)B(2) and b (3)A(2) states of NO(2) (+) is observed. At short pump probe delay times, the dominant multiphoton pathway for NO(+) formation is a 3x400 nm+1x266 nm excitation. At long delay times ({$>$}500 fs) two multiphoton pathways are observed. The dominant pathway is a 1x400 nm+2x266 nm photon excitation giving rise to very slow electrons and ions. A second pathway is a 3x400 nm photon absorption to NO(2) Rydberg states followed by dissociation toward neutral electronically and vibrationally excited NO(A (2)Sigma,v=1) fragments, ionized by one 266 nm photon absorption. As is shown in the present study, even though the pump-probe transients are rather featureless the photoelectron-photoion coincidence images show a complex time varying dynamics in NO(2). We present the potential of our novel coincidence imaging machine to unravel in unprecedented detail the various competing pathways in femtosecond time-resolved multichannel multiphoton dynamics of molecules.},

The technique employs wavepacket densities obtained with the multiple spawning method in conjunction with geometry- and energy-dependent photoionization matrix elements. The robust agreement of the calculated molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions with measured values for CS2 demonstrates that this approach can successfully illuminate, and disentangle, the underlying coupled nuclear and electronic dynamics around conical intersections in polyatomic molecules.},

  abstract = {Version 4.5 SHCoeffs Added cross\_spectrum(), plot\_cross\_spectrum() and plot\_cross\_spectrum2d() methods to the SHCoeffs class. Added from\_cap() constructor to create coefficients of a spherical cap. Fixed a small bug when rotating coefficients in the SHCoeffs, SHMagCoeffs and SHGravCoeffs classes when the input csphase is different from the default value. SHGrid Added the method from\_zeros() to initialize a grid with zeros. Added the method from\_cap() to initial a grid with a spherical cap. Added support for saving gridded data to netcdf and xarray formats. to\_netcdf() exports data to netcdf format, and when saved to file can be used directly with GMT (generic mapping tools) where they are known as 'grd' files. to\_xarray() exports data to an xarray DataArray. Fixed a type error when expanding complex coefficients at arbitrary points. Slepian functions Added the fortran function SHSCouplingMatrix and Slepain class method coupling matrix() for computing the coupling matrix that relates the Slepian expansion power spectrum to the global power spectrum. Added the fortran function SHSCouplingMatrixCap which is optimized for working with spherical cap Slepian functions. Improved the plotting capabilities of the method plot\_coupling\_matrix, such as the addition of colorbars, and the option to normalize to maximum value to unity. Added the option taper\_degrees() and slepian\_degrees() to the SHWindow and Slepian classes, respectively, to allow for the construction of Slepian functions that exclude certain spherical harmonic degrees. Added the fortran function SHMTVar and the SHWindow class method variance() to compute the variance of a multitaper spectral estimate (based on SHMTVarOpt). Added the fortran function SHSlepianVar and the Slepian class method variance() to compute the variance of a Slepian expansion spectral estimate. Improved the handing of the optional parameter weights in all methods of SHWindow. Changed the name of the optional parameter nwin of SHWindow.coupling\_matrix to k for consistency with the localized spectral analysis routines. Fortran 95 The Fortran code was modified to be strictly compliant with the f95 standard (-std=f95 in the gfortran compiler). Double precision, double complex, and long integers are defined as real(dp), complex(dp), and integer(int8), and the types are defined in a new module ftypes.f95. A few intrinsic function calls have been renamed to conform with the standards, and all double precision constants are now defined by appending \_dp to them. FFTW The syntax of the fftw routines has been updated. In particular, the old call dfftw\_execute(plan) statements now include all their dependent variables using the new syntax call fftw\_execute\_dft(plan, grid, coef). Importantly, the old syntax caused the GCC9 optimizer to break the spherical transform routines, generating meaningless output for large parts of the grids or coefficients. The fortran routines now access the FFTW library using Fortran 2003 standards. Though most compilers do not yet support all features of F2003, the few features used here (such as the module iso\_c\_binding) are claimed to be supported by the majority of modern compilers. This allows us to access the FFTW routines without use of fortran bindings, which are not always included in compiled versions of FFTW. All FFTW routines are explicitly defined in an interface block in FFTW3.f95. For simplicity, the use of the optional parameter FFTW\_UNDERSCORE used in the Makefile has been deprecated. M. A.

  abstract = {Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access, encouraging scientists to practice open-notebook science (such as openly sharing data and code), broader dissemination and engagement in science and generally making it easier to publish, access and communicate scientific knowledge. Usage of the term varies substantially across disciplines, with a notable prevalence in the STEM disciplines. Open research is often used quasi-synonymously to address the gap that the denotion of "science" might have regarding an inclusion of the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The primary focus connecting all disciplines is the widespread uptake of new technologies and tools, and the underlying ecology of the production, dissemination and reception of knowledge from a research-based point-of-view.As Tennant et al. (2020) note, the term open science "implicitly seems only to regard `scientific' disciplines, whereas open scholarship can be considered to include research from the Arts and Humanities, as well as the different roles and practices that researchers perform as educators and communicators, and an underlying open philosophy of sharing knowledge beyond research communities." Open science can be seen as a continuation of, rather than a revolution in, practices begun in the 17th century with the advent of the academic journal, when the societal demand for access to scientific knowledge reached a point at which it became necessary for groups of scientists to share resources with each other. In modern times there is debate about the extent to which scientific information should be shared. The conflict that led to the Open Science movement is between the desire of scientists to have access to shared resources versus the desire of individual entities to profit when other entities partake of their resources. Additionally, the status of open access and resources that are available for its promotion are likely to differ from one field of academic inquiry to another.},

Science 2.0 uses collaborative tools like wikis, blogs and video journals to share findings, raw data and "nascent theories" online. Science 2.0 benefits from openness and sharing, regarding papers and research ideas and partial solutions.A general view is that Science 2.0 is gaining traction with websites beginning to proliferate, yet at the same time there is considerable resistance within the scientific community about aspects of the transition as well as discussion about what, exactly, the term means. There are several views that there is a "sea change" happening in the status quo of scientific publishing, and substantive change regarding how scientists share research data. There is considerable discussion in the scientific community about whether scientists should embrace the model and exactly how Science 2.0 might work, as well as several reports that many scientists are slow to embrace collaborative methods and are somewhat "inhibited and slow to adopt a lot of online tools."},

  abstract = {In mathematics and physical science, spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a sphere. They are often employed in solving partial differential equations in many scientific fields. Since the spherical harmonics form a complete set of orthogonal functions and thus an orthonormal basis, each function defined on the surface of a sphere can be written as a sum of these spherical harmonics. This is similar to periodic functions defined on a circle that can be expressed as a sum of circular functions (sines and cosines) via Fourier series. Like the sines and cosines in Fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. Further, spherical harmonics are basis functions for irreducible representations of SO(3), the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus play a central role in the group theoretic discussion of SO(3). Spherical harmonics originate from solving Laplace's equation in the spherical domains. Functions that are solutions to Laplace's equation are called harmonics. Despite their name, spherical harmonics take their simplest form in Cartesian coordinates, where they can be defined as homogeneous polynomials of degree         {$\mathscr{l}$}     \textbackslash ell    in                (       x       ,       y       ,       z       )          (x,y,z)    that obey Laplace's equation. The connection with spherical coordinates arises immediately if one uses the homogeneity to extract a factor of radial dependence                r                {$\mathscr{l}$}                 r\^\{\textbackslash ell \}    from the above-mentioned polynomial of degree         {$\mathscr{l}$}     \textbackslash ell   ; the remaining factor can be regarded as a function of the spherical angular coordinates         \texttheta{}     \textbackslash theta    and         {$\varphi$}     \textbackslash varphi    only, or equivalently of the orientational unit vector                r          \textbackslash mathbf \{r\}    specified by these angles. In this setting, they may be viewed as the angular portion of a set of solutions to Laplace's equation in three dimensions, and this viewpoint is often taken as an alternative definition. Notice, however, that spherical harmonics are not functions on the sphere which are harmonic with respect to the Laplace-Beltrami operator  for the standard round metric on the sphere: the only harmonic functions in this sense on the sphere are the constants, since harmonic functions satisfy the Maximum principle. Spherical harmonics, as functions on the sphere, are eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (see the section Higher dimensions below). A specific set of spherical harmonics, denoted                                    Y                        {$\mathscr{l}$}                                   m                             (         \texttheta{}         ,         {$\varphi$}         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle Y\_\{\textbackslash ell \}\^\{m\}(\textbackslash theta ,\textbackslash varphi )\}    or                                    Y                        {$\mathscr{l}$}                                   m                             (                                 r                             )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle Y\_\{\textbackslash ell \}\^\{m\}(\{\textbackslash mathbf \{r\} \})\}   , are known as Laplace's spherical harmonics, as they were first introduced by Pierre Simon de Laplace in 1782. These functions form an orthogonal system, and are thus basic to the expansion of a general function on the sphere as alluded to above. Spherical harmonics are important in many theoretical and practical applications, including the representation of multipole electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, electron configurations, gravitational fields, geoids, the magnetic fields of planetary bodies and stars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. In 3D computer graphics, spherical harmonics play a role in a wide variety of topics including indirect lighting (ambient occlusion, global illumination, precomputed radiance transfer, etc.) and modelling of 3D shapes.},

  abstract = {The excited state dynamics of isolated sulfur dioxide molecules have been investigated using the time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and time-resolved photoelectron-photoion coincidence techniques. Excited state wavepackets were prepared in the spectroscopically complex, electronically mixed ([Formula: see text])(1)B1/(\~A)(1)A2, Clements manifold following broadband excitation at a range of photon energies between 4.03 eV and 4.28 eV (308 nm and 290 nm, respectively). The resulting wavepacket dynamics were monitored using a multiphoton ionisation probe. The extensive literature associated with the Clements bands has been summarised and a detailed time domain description of the ultrafast relaxation pathways occurring from the optically bright ([Formula: see text])(1)B1 diabatic state is presented. Signatures of the oscillatory motion on the ([Formula: see text])(1)B1/(\~A)(1)A2 lower adiabatic surface responsible for the Clements band structure were observed. The recorded spectra also indicate that a component of the excited state wavepacket undergoes intersystem crossing from the Clements manifold to the underlying triplet states on a sub-picosecond time scale. Photoelectron signal growth time constants have been predominantly associated with intersystem crossing to the ([Formula: see text])(3)B2 state and were measured to vary between 750 and 150 fs over the implemented pump photon energy range. Additionally, pump beam intensity studies were performed. These experiments highlighted parallel relaxation processes that occurred at the one- and two-pump-photon levels of excitation on similar time scales, obscuring the Clements band dynamics when high pump beam intensities were implemented. Hence, the Clements band dynamics may be difficult to disentangle from higher order processes when ultrashort laser pulses and less-differential probe techniques are implemented.},

Two different schemes are investigated: threshold electrons produced by one-photon ionization with parallel laser polarization and above threshold ionization electrons produced by a two-photon transition with crossed laser polarization. Our results show that the temporal coherence of light pulses is transferred to free electron wave packets, thus opening the door to a whole variety of exciting experiments.},

  abstract = {We present a method to discuss simultaneously the relative importance of molecular dynamic and geometric alignment induced by intense laser fields in theoretical view. This method divides the process of molecular alignment into three steps, which are tightly correlated with that of molecular multielectron dissociative ionization and Coulomb explosion. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm and a developed counting approach are used to calculate the angular distribution of molecules in the first and second steps of molecular alignment. The last step is described by a field-ionization, Coulomb explosion model. The angular distribution of molecules at the critical distance originated from geometric alignment is obtained by calculating the volume of shells associated with a series of particular angle. The final angular distributions of molecules are obtained by properly weighting the results of three steps. The numerical results of distinguishing between dynamic and geometric alignment for certain conditions are presented and discussed. Our computational results show that the alignment mechanism, which dominates the observed anisotropy of angular distributions of ionic fragments for a given condition, is determined by the dependences of the extent of dynamic and geometric alignment on laser parameters and molecular parameters.},

Depending on the problem at hand, different levels of TRPES measurements can be performed: time-resolved photoelectron yield; time- and energy-resolved photoelectron yield; time-, energy-, and angle-resolved photoelectron yield. In this pedagogical overview, a conceptual framework for time-resolved photoionization measurements is presented, together with discussion of relevant theory for the different aspects of TRPES. Simple models are used to illustrate the theory, and key concepts are further amplified by experimental examples. These examples are chosen to show the application of TRPES to the investigation of a range of problems in the excited state dynamics of molecules: from the simplest vibrational wavepacket on a single potential energy surface; to disentangling intrinsically coupled electronic and nuclear motions; to identifying the electronic character of the intermediate states involved in non-adiabatic dynamics by angle-resolved measurements in the molecular frame, the most complete measurement.},

  abstract = {We provide a simple physical picture of the molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPAD). In the energy region near the ionization threshold, it has been demonstrated that the MFPAD can be understood by the interference between several partial waves. In the energy region higher than 100eV, the MFPAD has been interpreted by the intra-molecule photoelectron diffraction. That is, it has been verified that multiple-scattering X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) theory is a promising probe of the dynamical process. Therefore, we look into the future: a new methodology for molecular structure determination will be applied to determine ultrafast molecular structure changes due to ultrafast core-level XPD imaging from within, as demonstrated in our simulations for elemental processes of photo-induced unimolecular reactions.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanically, photoionization can be fully described by the complex photoionization amplitudes that describe the transition between the ground state and the continuum state. Knowledge of the value of the phase of these amplitudes has been a central interest in photoionization studies and newly developing attosecond science, since the phase can reveal important information about phenomena such as electron correlation. We present a new attosecond-precision interferometric method of angle-resolved measurement for the phase of the photoionization amplitudes, using two phase-locked extreme ultraviolet pulses of frequency {$\omega$} and 2{$\omega$}, from a free-electron laser. Phase differences {$\Delta$}\texttildelow{$\eta$} between one- and two-photon ionization channels, averaged over multiple wave packets, are extracted for neon 2p electrons as a function of the emission angle at photoelectron energies 7.9, 10.2, and 16.6 eV. {$\Delta$}\texttildelow{$\eta$} is nearly constant for emission parallel to the electric vector but increases at 10.2 eV for emission perpendicular to the electric vector. We model our observations with both perturbation and ab initio theory and find excellent agreement. In the existing method for attosecond measurement, reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT), a phase difference between two-photon pathways involving absorption and emission of an infrared photon is extracted. Our method can be used for extraction of a phase difference between single-photon and two-photon pathways and provides a new tool for attosecond science, which is complementary to RABBITT.},

The advantages of this single-shot technique are demonstrated via a 26-ps chirped supercontinuum pulse used to measure the optical Kerr effect for three transparent organic liquids. The single-shot measurement results agree well with those of the time-resolved optical Kerr gate method, as regards both time and intensity. This method facilitates real-time observation of ultrafast optical Kerr responses of samples and simultaneous high-time-resolution data acquisition at {$\sim$}260 fs. We demonstrate that the single-shot measurement method is potentially a powerful tool for investigating the optical Kerr effects of unstable samples, and for application to high-power laser systems.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the breakdown of molecular-frame dynamics induced by the uncoupling of molecular rotation from electronic motion in molecular Rydberg states. We observe this non-Born-Oppenheimer regime in the time domain through photoelectron imaging of a coherent molecular Rydberg wave packet in \$\textbackslash textrm\{N\}\_2\$. The photoelectron angular distribution shows a radically different time evolution than that of a typical molecular-frame-fixed electron orbital, revealing the uncoupled motion of the electron as it precesses around the \$averaged\$ anisotropic potential of the rotating ion-core.},
